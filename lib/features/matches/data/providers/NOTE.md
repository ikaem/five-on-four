not sure if this should be here 
- i wanted to use this to provide data from the repository to the service
- possibly via some streams or some such

- or should this NOT put into streams
- it should just transform data from repositories into real app mdoels 
- and services should put them in appropriate streams 
  - or controlles should - we will see that 
  - so service should cache data - put into streams
